NoiseMetrics for ImAFUSA\
Date:13-Feb-2025\
This repository contains the first group of Noise Metrics calculated at receiver positions.

The directory structure is:\
 * MAIN
 * Coding
   * Scripts
     * .py files
 * Drone_DATA_Measurements
   * Ed_M3_10_F05_Y_W_134351_uw
     * .mat files
   * Ed_M3_10_HH_N_C_122827_nw
     * .mat files

## Python Files description:

Drones.py :\ 
It contains the Class UAM, which is the blueprint for a basic acpustic characterization of a UAM noise signal measured at specific location.

utils.py :\
It contains some filtering functions for the measured signals.

PyOctaveBand.py:\
This script contains the definitions for calculating 1/3 octave band frequency representation.
from: https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand

Usability.py : \
This iscript present an example of using the class UAM for characterizing UAM noise measurements.
The imputs are a 9-channel measurements .mat files contained in the the folder: "Drone_DATA_Measurements"

## UAM measurements data description:
Drone_DATA_Measurements folter contains two subfolders which could have more than one measurement of the same UAM operation. 

 * Ed_M3_10_F05_Y_W_134351_uw
 * Ed_M3_10_HH_N_C_122827_nw
